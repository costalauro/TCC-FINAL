# My FATEC Final Project - Rubens Lara, SISTREINA

Comments: This project was made for my CBT by Fatec Rubens Lara, it was a few years ago that I developed it (3 years) at the time I was starting to use Git.

Objective: The idea was to create a system for managing mandatory training, at the time the company I worked for needs something like this, so I took it to do my final project :)

Technologies used:
> Postgresql on the Heroku platform
> Haskell with the Yesod framework
> Javascript, very little at the time I wanted to see how far I could go only using Haskell, HTML, CSS and Yesod


I wanted to do this tcc to test the functional paradigm and the haskell language, as well as to challenge myself, at the time it would have been simple to do in C # and angular, but I decided to do something different, I don't regret it, it was a lot of fun.
